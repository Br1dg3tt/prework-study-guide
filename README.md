## Description

The motivation behind creating the prework study guide was to interactively use coding to build a webpage that organized and reflected on the information learned in the pre work section of the course.  I learned the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as learned how to utilize remote programs like GitBash and VS Code so that I could work separately on coding and troubleshooting before merging it into the main repository of my GitHub project.

## Usage

The Webpage is used to view information about each section of coding in a structured listed fashion, covering the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript and placing them in clear to read sections with bullet points to list each item learned about each topic.  You can also use DevTools as a reference for what to study first.
